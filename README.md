> **Introduction**

Bike sharing culture is on the rise particularly in urban cities. Many urbanites have adopted this mode of transport. It provides an alternative means of travelling that is cheaper, healthier and environmentally friendly. 

The City of Chicago launched Divvy, a new bike share system designed to connect people to transit, and to make short one-way trips across town easy. The Divvy bikes are gaining more popularity since its establishment in 2013.


> **Question**

The Divvy bikes has an impressive amount of 592 bike stations in Chicago city. We were particularly interested with the number of trips at these locations in 2017. When and where do bikers normally ride their rented Divvy bikes? 

We believed that these information would be useful to bikers, nearby and new businesses and the bike rental company itself. In view that these interested parties would be driven by different motives, it is essential that the shiny app allows the users to explore the bike trips in accordance with their preferences. 
It is challenging to visualize the distribution of bike trips across the 592 Divvy bike stations. Hence, we opted to develop the Shiny App to produce a spatial/map visualization of the bike trips.


> **Goal**

In order to answer our questions, we have to map out and categorize the popularity of the bike stations based on:
<ul>
  <li>specific date</li>
  <li>time frame</li>
  <li>gender</li>
</ul>
